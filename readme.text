KillBom Mercurial Extension
---------------------------

This Mercurial extension will remove the BOM from all UTF-8 encoded files.
Resulting file will still be UTF-8 but without the pesky BOM bytes.


To use it just add following in the `hgrc` or global Mercurial settings file:

    [extensions]
    killbom = /path/to/killbom.py
